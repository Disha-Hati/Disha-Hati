###  “Java is to JavaScript what Car is to Carpet.”- Chris Heilmann

An energetic, passionate, creative, flexible Second Year Student of Bachelor of Engineering currently studying Computer Science Engineering.

I love learning and am quite fast at conceptualizing concepts when it's something I'm interested in.

Want to expand in the domain of Web Development with growth-oriented organization where I can utilize my knowledge by seeking proper opportunities.
